# Some Dot Files

These are some dotfiles I want wherever and whenever I work. Mostly basic bash
and vim customization. I made a quick pass at organizing the bash config files
by functionality.

The installation script and basic file structure are taken from Zach Holman's
dotfiles. https://github.com/holman/dotfiles.git

The installation script is a bit overkill for this few files, but it's all
part of the fun.
